Security Policy
===============

If you discover a security vulnerability within Guardrails, please email a maintainers' contact for a coordinated disclosure or open a private security advisory on GitHub. Do not create a public GitHub issue.

We will coordinate a fix and release as soon as possible. Thank you for helping keep our users safe.
